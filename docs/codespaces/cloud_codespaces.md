2. **Repository Access**:  
   - The repository must be hosted on GitHub, and you need write access to create a Codespace.

3. **Visual Studio Code (Optional)**:  
   - Install **Visual Studio Code** for a richer experience.  
   - Download from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  
   - Install the **GitHub Codespaces** extension from the VS Code marketplace.

## 🚀 Setting Up GitHub Codespaces

1. **Enable Codespaces**:  
   - Go to your repository's **Settings** > **Codespaces** and enable it.

2. **Configure the `.devcontainer` Folder**:  
   - Add a `.devcontainer` folder with the following files:
     - **[`Dockerfile`](./cloud_example/.devcontainer/Dockerfile)**: Installs tools like:
       - Azure CLI (with Bicep CLI)
       - Terraform
       - OpenTofu
       - Dagger CLI
     - **[`devcontainer.json`](./cloud_example/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json)**: Configures VS Code extensions and settings.
     - **[`settings.json`](./cloud_example/.devcontainer/settings.json)**: Ensures required extensions (e.g., Docker, Terraform, Bicep) are installed.

3. **Start a Codespace**:  
   - Open your repository on GitHub, click the **Code** button, and select the **Codespaces** tab.  
   - Click **Create Codespace on Main** (or your desired branch).  
   - GitHub will launch the Codespace, automatically building the container using the `.devcontainer` folder.
