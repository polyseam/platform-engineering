# 🧑‍💻 Dagger Hackathon: June 18th, 2025

Welcome to the Dagger hackathon hosted by the CNCF and Code to Cloud! By the end of this hack, you will have a good understanding of how to use Dagger and the various use cases it can help support.

## 🎯 Expected Outcomes

✅ Build a real-world use case with Dagger

✅ Dagger pipeline runs unit tests

✅ Dagger pipeline triggers LLM workflow if tests fail

✅ LLM provides feedback on why tests could be failing in a PR

## ✅ Prerequisites

There are two options for this hackathon. We highly recommend the first option to avoid dependency issues.

### 1️⃣ Option 1: Github Codespace

### 2️⃣ Option 2: Local

Make sure to follow the prerequisites defined [here](../README.md) in the main Dagger README.

## 🔨 Implementation

All the code for the below can be found [here](./dagger-hackathon-pipeline/).

Make sure you have the repo cloned and you are in the `docs\dagger\dagger-hackathon-pipeline` directory:

```bash
# Clone the repository from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/codetocloudorg/platform-engineering.git

# Change directory to the Dagger hackathon pipeline documentation folder
cd ./docs/dagger/dagger-hackathon-pipeline
```

### Step 1: Create a Feature Branch

### 🤖 Step 2: Select your LLM Provider

### Step 3: Create a PR

### Step 4: Run the Dagger Function
