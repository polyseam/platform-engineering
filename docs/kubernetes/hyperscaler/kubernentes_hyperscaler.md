# ☁️ Kubernetes on Cloud Providers

Managed Kubernetes services from major cloud providers (hyperscalers) simplify cluster operations by automating control plane management, upgrades, scaling, and integration with cloud-native services. These offerings allow teams to focus on deploying and managing applications, while the provider handles much of the infrastructure complexity.
