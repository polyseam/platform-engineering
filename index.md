## 🏢 Project Overview

### 🎉 Acknowledgements

We extend our heartfelt gratitude to the **Code to Cloud** community for their continuous support and contributions.  
You can connect with them on their [socials page](https://connect.codetocloud.io).

### ✍️ Author

Started by **[Kevin Evans](https://linktr.ee/bash.sh)** as a way to document his journey in Platform Engineering, this repository has evolved into a centralized hub for platform engineering teams. It provides resources, best practices, and automation tools, including IaC templates, blueprints, and operational guides to help build scalable, secure, and efficient platforms for cloud-native environments and DevOps workflows.  
*Fun fact:* The idea for this repo came while **[Kevin](https://linktr.ee/bash.sh)** was watching *[Big Trouble in Little China](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090728/)*—because, as **Jack Burton** would say, *"It's all in the reflexes."*

### 📈 Project Evolution

What began as a personal learning journey has evolved into a structured learning resource for Platform Engineering principles, processes, and tooling. We encourage community contributions, feedback, and discussions to further enrich this repository.

### 🚀 Focus Areas

- **Platform Engineering**: Continuous integration, continuous delivery, infrastructure as code, and more.
- **DevSecOps**: Integrating security practices into the DevOps pipeline.
- **Community Sessions**: Interactive sessions and discussions to foster learning and collaboration.

### 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

This project is not vendor-sponsored and utilizes free, community, and open-source software.

## 📚 Platform Engineering Knowledge Base

### 🌐 What is Platform Engineering?

Platform Engineering builds on DevOps principles to enhance **security**, **compliance**, **cost efficiency**, and **time-to-value** by improving developer experiences and enabling self-service within a secure, governed framework.

It’s both a **mindset shift** and a **set of tools and systems** designed to reduce friction in development. Well-designed platforms eliminate toil by streamlining developer workflows and simplifying operations. These platforms include tools that:

- **Empower developers** with self-service options (e.g., starter kits, IDE plugins)
- **Automate common tasks**
- **Encapsulate best practices** into reusable components
- **Provide early feedback** on issues like security risks
- **Manage infrastructure and tools** to simplify operations

This approach enables development teams to focus on building and delivering value efficiently.

### 🚀 Why Platform Engineering?

In today's fast-paced tech environment, organizations need to innovate quickly while maintaining high standards of reliability and security. Platform Engineering addresses these needs by:

- **🚀 Accelerating Development**: Providing developers with easy access to the tools and environments they need, reducing the time spent on setup and configuration.
- **🔒 Enhancing Security**: Implementing consistent security practices across the platform, ensuring compliance and protecting sensitive data.
- **📈 Improving Reliability**: Standardizing infrastructure and processes to reduce errors and increase system stability.
- **💡 Fostering Innovation**: Enabling teams to experiment and iterate rapidly by providing a flexible and scalable platform.

### 🛠️ Platform Tooling Landscape

The platform engineering tooling landscape is rapidly evolving, encompassing a wide range of technologies that streamline developer workflows, enhance automation, and improve infrastructure management. This includes:

- **Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs)**
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** tools
- **GitOps workflows**
- **Service meshes**
- **Cloud-native runtime environments**

- **[Platform Engineering Landscape Overview](docs/platform_engineering_landscape.md)** 🚀

### 🔑 Key Components of Platform Engineering

Platform Engineering encompasses several key components:

- **[Infrastructure as Code (IaC)](docs/iac.md)**
- **[Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD)](docs/ci_cd.md)**
- **[Codespaces](docs/codespaces.md)**
- **[Monitoring and Observability](docs/monitoring.md)**
- **[Security and Compliance](docs/security.md)**
- **[Automation and Scripting](docs/automation.md)**
- **[Cloud-Native Architectures](docs/cloud_native.md)**

- **[Kubernetes](docs/kubernetes.md)**
- **[Podcasts](docs/podcasts.md)**
- **[Developer Experience (Local Platform Engineering Toolset)](docs/development_setup.md)**

### 🏗️ Platform Engineering Reference Architecture

A **Platform Engineering Reference Architecture** provides a standardized framework for building scalable, secure, and efficient internal developer platforms (IDPs). It integrates key components like **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**, **GitOps workflows**, **Kubernetes-based orchestration**, and **self-service developer portals** to streamline cloud-native application delivery.

#### 🌥️ Cloud-Specific Architectures
