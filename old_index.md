## ✍️ Author

<!-- Brief history of the repository and its evolution -->
Started by **[Kevin Evans](https://linktr.ee/bash.sh)** as a way to document his journey in Platform Engineering, this repository has evolved into a centralized hub for platform engineering teams. It provides resources, best practices, and automation tools, including IaC templates, blueprints, and operational guides to help build scalable, secure, and efficient platforms for cloud-native environments and DevOps workflows.  

<!-- Fun fact about the inspiration for the repository -->
The idea for this repo came while  **[Kevin](https://linktr.ee/bash.sh)** was watching *[Big Trouble in Little China](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090728/)*—because, as **Jack Burton** would say, *"It's all in the reflexes."*
